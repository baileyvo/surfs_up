# Surfs Up
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to give more information about temperature trends, specifically what temperatures look like in June and December in Oahu. This information will be used to determine if a surf/ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round for W. Avy.

### Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.7.11, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6

## Results
### Summary Statistics for June and December

### Insights
Three insights can be garnered from the summary statistics for June and December:
- The average temperature for both June and December is in the 70s, with the June mean being 74.9 degrees, and December being 71.0 degrees.
- The max temperatures are similarly related, with the June max temperature being 85 degrees and the December max temperature being 83 degrees.
- the minimum temperatures showed the largest difference, with the June minimum being 64 degrees and the December minimum being 56 degrees. 

## Summary
After this analysis, it can safely be said that temperature concerns should be put to rest. June and December show similar temperatures, which are well within range of supporting a surf/ice cream shop.

Two additional queries can be recommended to gather more weather data for June and December:
- The precipitation could be reviewed in a similar way to the analysis here, as that could impact people's willingness to visit the shop.
- Trends could be graphed for June/December temperatures over the time this data was collected, to see if climate change is causing more extreme temperatures.
